# Document-AWS-VPC-LAMP-Stack
Created a secure AWS cloud environment to host a web app, designing a custom VPC with public/private subnets, deploying Ubuntu EC2 instances, and configuring a LAMP stack. Implemented IAM role-based access, security groups, and key-pair authentication, applying least privilege and testing for security, functionality, and resilience.
