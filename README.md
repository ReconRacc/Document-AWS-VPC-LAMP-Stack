# Document-AWS-VPC-LAMP-Stack
I created a secure cloud environment in AWS to simulate hosting and managing a web application. The project included designing a custom VPC with both public and private subnets, launching and configuring Ubuntu EC2 instances, and setting up a LAMP stack for web hosting. I implemented IAM role-based access controls, configured security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, and restricted SSH access to specific IPs. To enhance security and operational management, I applied the principle of least privilege, enforced key-pair authentication, and documented all configurations. The environment was tested for connectivity, functionality, and resilience, with adjustments made to improve security and efficiency.
